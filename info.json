And also in the SEK2BZ combo for a very so called fun experience.\nAdds Manganese and some alloys.\n\nAlmost all of the code is a modified version of the code in Brevven's mods (the BZ mods) It's quite useful as a base for making a mod I'd say :D\n\nMost of the graphics is placeholderish, will have to do something about that xD",
